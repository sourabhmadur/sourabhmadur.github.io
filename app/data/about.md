Hi! I'm Sourabh and i'm a software engineer by profession..
<br />
<br />
During undergrad, my inquisitiveness with how things work led me to work on projects in Theoretical Physics and Computational Neuroscience.  I moved to US in 2018 for Grad school at Columbia where I've worked on projects at the intersection of Software Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning. The most important skill I learned here was thinking in terms of abstractions, which was in stark contrast to the first principles based thinking that I was used to during my education in physics.
<br />
<br />
I spent the summer of 2019 interning at a Fintech startup in midtown, NY called Canoe Intelligence, where I developed algorithms for automatic data extraction from alternative investment documents. Specifically, I worked on implementing Deep Learning(for Computer Vision) algorithms to extract data from Hedge Fund, Private Equity and Venture Capital documents. 
<br />
<br />

After graduating from Columbia, I joined Oracle as a software engineer and am working as backend developer for OCI. 

I'm interested in meeting VCs, Angel Investors, entrepreneurs, executive mentors, and anyone working on anything interesting (very broadly defined). Please feel free to contact.
